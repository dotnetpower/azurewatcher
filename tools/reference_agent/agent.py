"""Pinned reference agent for Phase 0 baseline measurement.

The reference agent is the **fixed comparison system** measured in Phase 0:
one model, no tiering, no quality gate. Every autonomy claim later stated
by AIOpsPilot is measured against this agent on the frozen scenario set.

Real deployments will swap this stub for a hosted LLM. Today the stub is
intentionally simple:

- **Single decision rule**: always route to HIL. That mirrors a
  conservative "single-model, no tiering" baseline that a human operator
  would sign off on every action.
- **Deterministic**: no randomness, no wall-clock — two runs on the same
  scenario version yield byte-identical results.
- **Cost-free**: no LLM call, no network. Tests can invoke it in-process.

This is the shape the baseline runner consumes. When the real reference
agent lands, it MUST honour the same :class:`AgentDecision` contract so
the runner (and its report artifact) do not change.
